Controlling PSG9080 signal generator through the included bluetooth module.

The module that came with the signal generator have the chips deleted, but apparently it is a `JDY-31 SPP` or similar.
The board is connected to the TTL Communication Extension Port of the PSG9080 (see page 20 of manual - http://68.168.132.244/PSG9080_EN_manual.pdf).
The serial protocol is indicated in the "PSG Communication Protocol.pdf" included in http://68.168.132.244/PSG9080_EN_Setup.zip.
